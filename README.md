# Pap-Smear-Classification

The goal of this project is to develop a classification model that will be able to identify the cervical dysplasia in two main categories, normal and abnormal. The data set that I’mworking on has a target divided into 7 categories depending on how serious the dysplasia is. In order to divide these categories I will try to implement two unsupervised methods aiming to find:
1.	The number of the clusters. 

2.	How I would split up these clusters.

In addition,I will  implement some techniques to determine highly correlated features and a dimension reduction method in order to identify patterns and divide the target column into less categories.
